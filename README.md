# About me 🥷

An independent security researcher with great attention to detail that loves to break down complexity and offer easy practical solutions. 

As of date (July 2024) I'm sitting at the **21th** spot on the 90-day [Code4rena leaderboard](https://code4rena.com/@ilchovski), secured multiple DeFi and Cross-Chain protocols and has multiple top 1-10 finishes in competative audits.

With more than 2 years of experience in the blockchain industry I provide value to protocols in the form of smart contract security reviews and consultations regarding security approaches and best practices.
